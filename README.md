# markov_text_composer
This small project is an implementation of a Markov Chain which can compose text.

## CLI Usage

Run the composer from the command line using `compose_cli.py`:

```zsh
python3 compose_cli.py <file_or_dir> [start_word] [length]
```

Defaults: `length` = 50. Provide `start_word` to begin from a specific word.
